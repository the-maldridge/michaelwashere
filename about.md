My name is Michael Aldridge, I work with computers and this is my
website.  From time to time I post information here on projects I'm
working on or on things that I've found that I want to make sure I can
find again.

I am an SRE at Google.  I am one of a team of people responsible for
making sure that the production fleet stays healthy and serving.  Its
a lot of fun and a truly unique place to work.

In my spare time I work on Void Linux as the guy that manages the
infrastructure and build pipelines.  Its a lot of fun and a unique
challenge to work at the opposite end of the scale from Google in
terms of size.

The information on this site is interesting to me, I hope it can be of
use to others.  If you have any questions feel free
to [email me](mailto:aldridge.mac@gmail.com).

My name is Michael Aldridge, I work with computers and this is my website.  From time to time I post information here on projects I'm working on or on things that I've found that I want to make sure I can find again.

I currently work with the Collegium V Honors College at The University of Texas at Dallas where I manage the day to day operations of the honors computer lab and associated servers.  Those systems run CVOS which you can read more about [here](http://www.github.com/collegiumv/cv_client/).

I am also a licensed amatuer radio operator and occasionally have the pleasure of working with others to launch high altitude balloons.  If you are active on the UTD repeater (K5UTD), feel free to ping me, I'm KG5DGR.

The information on this site is interesting to me, I hope it can be of use to others.  If you have any questions feel free to [email me](mailto:aldridge.mac@gmail.com).
